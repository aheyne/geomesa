GeoMesa Scala Console
=====================

The GeoMesa tools have a ``scala-console`` command that starts a Scala REPL with the
GeoMesa classpath and configuration for that distribution on the REPL's classpath.
This is useful for testing and prototyping code. The command comes with additionaly
tooling that will provide the option to download and run the appropriate version Scala
if it is not availabe. This is a portableinstall and will not alter the machines
current configuration.

Example usage
-------------

The following example was performed against the FileSystemDatastore generated by the
:ref:`fsds_quickstart`. It shows how to

GeoMesa distributions ship with converter definitions for several common data types
including Twitter, GeoNames, T-drive, and more. See :ref:`prepackaged_converters` for full details.

These converters are available via classpath loading, as described next. Available converters can
be examined using the :ref:`cli_env` command.

Classpath Loading
-----------------

GeoMesa uses the `TypeSafe Config <https://github.com/lightbend/config>`_ library for loading
converters from the classpath. Following convention, GeoMesa will load the default
configuration, which is defined by the files ``reference.conf`` and/or ``application.conf``. In
the binary distributions, those files are included in the ``conf`` directory, with a variety of
pre-defined types. See :ref:`prepackaged_converters` for more information on the provided types.

Users can modify these files to define their own converters. By default, converters should be
defined as objects under the path ``geomesa.converters``. They are identified by their key.

See :ref:`converters` for details on creating converters.

Once a converter has been defined on the classpath, it can be referenced by its well-known name, i.e.
the object key under ``geomesa.converters``. Available converters can be examined using the
:ref:`cli_env` command.

Configuration String
--------------------

Instead of defining a converter configuration on the classpath, the same configuration string can
be passed directly as an argument. Be careful to ensure the definition is still nested under
``geomesa.converters``.

File Name
---------

Instead of defining them directly on the command line, a converter can be defined in a file containing
a configuration string. The file can then be referenced by name.
